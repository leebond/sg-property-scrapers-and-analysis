This folder contains a web scraper 
- `scrape-HDB-resale-historical-prices.py` that scrapes transaction details of HDB Resale units.

### Analysis
I am in progress of adding a iPython Notebook that analyses HDB resale transactions.
You may find the analysis in `HDB Resale Analysis.ipynb` in time to come.

Here are some prelimnary analyses:
