# Description
Selenium Python web scrapers for HDB housing data.

Currently, I have scrapers for..
- HDB SBF units which are not booked
- HDB SBF application status
- HDB Resale prices and details

## Motivation
To open-source my work so that more people can access HDB's information.

## Implementation
- I have implemented python scrapers that uses Selenium to crawl data from HDB website.
- As of 12 July 2020, I have used Chromedriver ver 83.0.4103.39 (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) to navigate the webpages.
